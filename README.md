# JUnitMockitoTestWizard

## Overview
**JUnitMockitoTestWizard** is a Maven-based project designed to explore and practice testing techniques using **JUnit** and **Mockito**.
This project is part of my journey to master unit testing in Java. It includes various test cases and examples that demonstrate the usage of these popular testing frameworks.

## Features
- **JUnit**: Used for creating and running unit tests.
- **Mockito**: A mocking framework that helps in writing clear and concise tests by simulating the behavior of complex objects.
- **Maven**: Manages dependencies, builds the project, and runs the tests.
